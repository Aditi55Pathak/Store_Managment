## STORE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 

## Project Description

The Store Management Project 2019 was a pivotal endeavor aimed at revolutionizing the inventory management process for retail stores. It focused on enhancing efficiency and accuracy in store operations through seamless order management and reporting capabilities.

## My Role
I played a crucial role in the project, focusing on two key aspects: planning and designing the project's blueprint as Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) and designing the user interface/experience (UI/UX) with core knowledge.

## Technologies Used
The project leveraged a robust tech stack including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. These technologies were instrumental in developing a responsive and dynamic front-end, coupled with a robust back-end for efficient data management.

## Key Features and Functionalities

Order Management: The system facilitated the seamless processing of orders from colleges for various goods such as chairs and tables.

Database Management: Requests from colleges were centralized and sorted according to needs before being sent to nearby local stores.

Vendor Selection: Local stores with the right goods and competitive prices were selected, and responses were integrated back into the central database.

Inventory Tracking: Store managers could easily track inventory levels, manage orders, and generate reports for better decision-making.

Future Plans: I envision transforming this project into a cloud-based solution and integrating Customer Relationship Management (CRM) functionality using Salesforce. This evolution will further enhance its scalability, accessibility, and customer-centric approach.
